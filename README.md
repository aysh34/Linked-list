# Linked List

This repository contains implementation of linked list data structure in python programming language.


## Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. It is a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink in size during program execution.

## Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion at the beginning or end of the list, but accessing elements in the middle requires traversing the list from the beginning.

## Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains a data element, a reference to the previous node, and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion at any position in the list, but requires more memory compared to a singly linked list.

## Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node in the list points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. It can be implemented as a singly linked list or a doubly linked list. Circular linked lists are useful in applications where elements need to be accessed in a circular manner.
